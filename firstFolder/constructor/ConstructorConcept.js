/*
Constructor 
    it's a special method 
        in JS: name of the constructor is always "constructor"
        in Java: name of the constructor is same as of the class-name
    the use of constructor function is to cerate object of the class

    When there is NO constructor in a class
        js creates a default constructor, then execute it in order to create the object
