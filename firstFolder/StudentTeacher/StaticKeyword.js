/*
static variables/functions belong the class instead of object

non static variables belong to the object 

if a static variable is changed by any object, the value gets changed for all objects 

To use static variable/function 

    we have to use ClassName instead of objectname or this operator

if the purpose of function should be perfomed by indidivual object/entity
    then unction should be non static

if function
